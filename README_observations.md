##AtoB  HockeyVideo ---Rugby Transforming--->  RugbySTyle HOckey Rink   (GReen Ice)
32k Green Hockey Rink gets overtrained, starts becoming black
--- PRobably due to some training data being a closeup mash of allblack players (flesh and jersey)

Lots of blue appears in crowd

### Rugby w/ HockeyMod
When players cluster up, it thinks they are close to a net (A hihgly occurring scenario in the hockey footage)... So the color light blue appears on the ground (from the goal crease area), aswell as red goalposts.

Rugby players now have hockey sticks when moving at times !!!!!!!!!!!

#####Hockey w/ RugbyMOd

Less black patch anomalies than 32k.
There are now bright yellow patches, but this is from adding in new training data which contained yellow rugby jerseys.

As hoped for, the jerseys of the hockey players took on the new training data's jersey colors of Green/Red.
